*You will continue the development of the report created in the **Design a Report in Power BI Desktop** lab.*

1. In Power BI Desktop, on the **Overview** page, set the **Year** slicer to **FY2018**.

2. Go to the **My Performance** page, and then notice that the **Year** slicer is a different value.

	*When slicers aren’t synced it can contribute to misrepresentation of data and frustration for report users. You’ll now sync the report slicers.*

3. Return to the **Overview** page, and then select the **Year** slicer.

4. On the **View** ribbon tab, from inside the **Show Panes** group, click **Sync Slicers**.

	![Picture 1](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(13).png)

5. In the **Sync Slicers** pane (at the left of the **Visualizations** pane), in the second column (which represents syncing), check the checkboxes for the **Overview** and **My Performance** pages.

	![Picture 93](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(14).png)

6. On the **Overview** page, select the **Region** slicer.

7. Sync the slicer with the **Overview** and **Profit** pages.

## **Exercise 2: Configure Drill Through**

In this exercise you will create a new page and configure it as a drill through page. When you’ve completed the design, the page will look like the following:

![Image of the new page, comprising a card visual and table visual.](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(17).png)

### **Task 1: Create a drill through page**

In this task you will create a new page and configure it as a drill through page.

1. Add a new report page named **Product Details**.

	![Picture 95](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(18).png)

2. Right-click the **Product Details** page tab, and then select **Hide Page**.

	![Picture 97](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(19).png)

	*Report users won’t be able to go to the drill through page directly. They’ll need to access it from visuals on other pages. You’ll learn how to drill through to the page in the final exercise of this lab.*

3. Beneath the **Visualizations** pane, in the **Drill Through** section, add the **Product \| Category** field to the **Add Drill-Through Fields Here** box.

	*The labs use a shorthand notation to reference a field. It will look like this: **Product \| Category**. In this example, **Product** is the table name and **Category** is the field name.*

	![Picture 96](Linked_image_Files/lab7-image(20).png)

4. To test the drill through page, in the drill through filter card, select **Bikes**.

	![Picture 99](Linked_image_Files/lab7-image(21).png)

5. At the top-left of the report page, notice the arrow button.

	![Picture 100](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(22).png)

	*A button is added automatically when a field is added to the drill through well/area. It allows report users to navigate back to the page from which they drilled through.*

6. Add a **Card** visual to the page, and then resize and position it so it sits to the right of the button and fills the remaining width of the page.

	![Picture 13](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(23).png)

	![Picture 101](Linked_image_Files/08-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop-enhanced_image24.png)

7. Drag the **Product \| Category** field into the card visual.

8. Configure the format options for the visual, and then turn the **Category Label** property to **Off**.

	![Picture 103](Linked_image_Files/lab7-image-(25).png)

9. Set the **Background Color** property to a light shade of gray.

	![Picture 103](Linked_image_Files/background.png)

10. Add a **Table** visual to the page, and then resize and position it so it sits beneath the card visual and fills the remaining space on the page.

	![Picture 14](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(26).png)

	![Picture 105](Linked_image_Files/08-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop-enhanced_image27.png)

11. Add the following fields to the visual:

	- Product \| Subcategory

	- Product \| Color

	- Sales \| Quantity

	- Sales \| Sales

	- Sales \| Profit Margin

	![Picture 103](Linked_image_Files/fields.png)

12. Configure the format options for the visual, and in the **Values** section, set the **Text Size** property to **20pt**.

    ![Picture 103](Linked_image_Files/textsize.png)

	*The design of the drill through page is almost complete. You’ll enhance the page with conditional formatting in the next exercise.*

## **Exercise 3: Add Conditional Formatting**

In this exercise you will enhance the drill through page with conditional formatting. When you’ve completed the design, the page will look like the following:

![Image of an updated page, revealing color formatted values and icons.](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(28).png)

### **Task 1: Add conditional formatting**

In this task you will enhance the drill through page with conditional formatting.

1. Select the table visual.

2. In the visualization pane, click the down-arrow on the **Profit Margin** value, and then select **Conditional Formatting \| Icons**.

	![Picture 107](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(29).png)

3. In the **Icons – Profit Margin** window, in the **Icon Layout** dropdown list, select **Right of Data**.

	![Picture 108](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(30).png)

4. To delete the middle rule, at the right of the yellow triangle, select **X**.

	![Picture 109](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(31).png)

5. Configure the first rule (red diamond) as follows:

	- In the second control, remove the value

	- In the third control, select **Number**

	- In the fifth control, enter **0**

	- In the sixth control, select **Number**

6. Configure the second rule (green circle) as follows:

	- In the second control, enter **0**

	- In the third control, select **Number**

	- In the fifth control, remove the value

	- In the sixth control, select **Number**

	![Picture 110](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(32).png)

	*The rules can be interpreted as follows: display a red diamond if the profit margin value is less than 0; otherwise if the value is great or equal to zero, display a green circle.*

7. Click **OK**.

	![Picture 111](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(33).png)

8. In the table visual, verify that the that the correct icons are displayed.

	![Picture 112](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(34).png)

9. Configure background color conditional formatting for the **Color** field.

10. In the **Background Color – Color** window, in the **Format Style** dropdown list, select **Field Value**.

	

11. In the **What field should we base this on?** dropdown list, select **Product \| Formatting \| Background Color Format**.

	![Picture 114](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(36).png)

12. Click **OK**.

	![Picture 115](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(37).png)

13. Repeat the previous steps to configure font color conditional formatting for the **Color** field, using the **Product \| Formatting \| Font Color Format** field

	*You may recall that the background and font colors were source from the **ColorFormats.csv** file in the **Prepare Data in Power BI Desktop** lab, and then integrated with the **Product** query in the **Load Data in Power BI Desktop** lab.*

## **Exercise 4: Add Bookmarks and Buttons**

In this exercise you will enhance the **My Performance** page with buttons, allowing the report user to select the visual type to display. When you’ve completed the design, the page will look like the following:

![Image of an updated page 3, showing two buttons and now just two visuals.](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(38).png)

### **Task 1: Add bookmarks**

In this task you will add two bookmarks, one to display each of the monthly sales/targets visuals.

1. Go to the **My Performance** page.

2. On the **View** ribbon tab, from inside the **Show Panes** group, click **Bookmarks**.

	![Picture 118](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(39).png)

3. On the **View** ribbon tab, from inside the **Show Panes** group, click **Selection**.

	![Picture 119](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(40).png)

4. In the **Selection** pane, beside one of the **Sales and Target by Month** items, to hide the visual, click the eye icon.

	![Picture 120](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(41).png)

5. In the **Bookmarks** pane, click **Add**.

	![Picture 121](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(42).png)

6. To rename the bookmark, double-click the bookmark.

7. If the visible chart is the bar chart, rename the bookmark as **Bar Chart ON** .

8. To edit the bookmark, in the **Bookmarks** pane, hover the cursor over the bookmark, click the ellipsis, and then select **Data**.

	![Picture 16](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image43.png)

	*Disabling the **Data** option means the bookmark won’t use the current filter state. That’s important because otherwise the bookmark would permanently lock in the filter currently applied by the **Year** slicer.*

9. To update the bookmark, click the ellipsis again, and then select **Update**.

	![Picture 18](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(44).png)

	*In the following steps, you’ll create and configure a second bookmark to show the second visual.*

10. In the **Selection** pane, toggle the visibility of the two **Sales and Target by Month** items.

	*In other words, make the visible visual hidden, and make the hidden visual visible.*

	![Picture 122](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(45).png)

11. Create a second bookmark, and name it as **Column Chart ON**

	![Picture 123](Linked_image_Files/Lab7-image(46).png)

12. Configure the second bookmark to ignore filters (**Data** option off), and update the bookmark.

13. In the **Selection** pane, to make both visuals visible, simply show the hidden visual.

14. Resize and reposition both visuals so they fill the page beneath the multi-card visual, and completely overlap one another.

	*Tip: To select the visual that is covered up, select it in the **Selection** pane.*

	![Picture 124](Linked_image_Files/08-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop-enhanced_image47.png)

15. In the **Bookmarks** pane, select each of the bookmarks, and notice that only one of the visuals is visible.

	*The next stage of design is to add two buttons to the page, which will allow the report user to select the bookmarks.*

### **Task 2: Add buttons**

In this task you will add two buttons, and assign bookmark actions to each.

1. On the **Insert** ribbon, from inside the **Elements** group, click **Button**, and then select **Blank**.

	![Picture 125](Linked_image_Files/lab7-image(48).png)

2. Position the button directly beneath the **Year** slicer.

3. Select the button, and then in the **Format button** pane, turn the **Title** property to **On**.

	![Picture 126](Linked_image_Files/lab7-image(49).png)

4. Expand the **Title** section, and then in the **Title Text** box, enter **Bar Chart**.

	![](Linked_image_Files/barchart.png)

5. Expand the **Fill** section, and then set a fill color using a complementary color.

6. Expand **Action** section and turn the **Action** property to **On**.

7. Expand the **Action** section, and then set the **Type** dropdown list to **Bookmark**.

8. In the **Bookmark** dropdown list, select **Bar Chart ON**.

	![Picture 128](Linked_image_Files/lab7-image(51).png)

9. Create a copy of the button by using copy and paste, and then configure the new button as follows:

	*Tip: The shortcut commands for copy and paste are **Ctrl+C** followed by **Ctrl+V**.*

	- Set the **Button Text** property to **Column Chart**

	- In the **Action** section, set the **Bookmark** dropdown list to **Column Chart ON**

	*The design of the Sales Analysis report is now complete.*

### **Task 3: Publish the report**

In this task you will publish the report.

1. Select the **Overview** page.

2. In the **Year** slicer, select **FY2020**.

3. In the **Region** slicer, select **Select All**.

4. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

	*The file must always be saved prior to publishing to the Power BI service.*
