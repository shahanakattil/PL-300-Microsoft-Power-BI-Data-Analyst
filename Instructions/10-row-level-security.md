# **PL-300 Module 10: Enforce Row-Level Security**

In this lab you will create a many-to-many relationship between the **Salesperson** table and the **Sales** table. You will also enforce row-level security to ensure that a salesperson can only analyze sales data for their assigned region(s).

In this lab you learn how to:

- Configure many-to-many relationships

- Enforce row-level security

### **Lab story**

1. Prepare Data in Power BI Desktop

2. Load Data in Power BI Desktop

3. Model Data in Power BI Desktop

4. Create DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop

5. Create Advanced DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop

### **Task 2: Enforce row-level security**

In this task you will enforce row-level security to ensure a salesperson can only see sales made in their assigned region(s).

1. Switch to Data view.

	![Picture 5701](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image20.png)

2. In the **Fields** pane, select the **Salesperson (Performance)** table.

3. Review the data, noticing that Michael Blythe (EmployeeKey 281) has a UPN value of: *michael-blythe@adventureworks.com*

	*Recall that Michael Blythe is assigned to three sales regions: US Northeast, US Central, and US Southeast.*

4. Switch to Report view.

5. On the **Modeling** ribbon tab, from inside the **Security** group, click **Manage Roles**.

	![Picture 5700](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image21.png)

6. In the **Manage Roles** window, click **Create**.

	![Picture 5702](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image22.png)

7. In the box, replace the selected text with the name of the role: **Salespeople**, and then press **Enter**.

	![Picture 5703](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image23.png)

8. To assign a filter, for the **Salesperson (Performance)** table, click the ellipsis (…) character, and then select **Add Filter \| [UPN]**.

	![Picture 5704](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image24.png)

9. In the **Table Filter DAX Expression** box, modify the expression by replacing **“Value”** with **USERPRINCIPALNAME()**.

	![Picture 11](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image25.png)

	*USERPRINCIPALNAME() is a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) function that returns the name of the authenticated user. It means that the **Salesperson (Performance)** table will filter by the User Principal Name (UPN) of the user querying the model.*

10. Click **Save**.

	![Picture 5706](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image26.png)

11. To test the security role, on the **Modeling** ribbon tab, from inside the **Security** group, click **View As**.

	![Picture 5708](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image27.png)

12. In the **View as Roles** window, check the **Other User** item, and then in the corresponding box, enter: *michael-blythe@adventureworks.com*

13. Check the **Salespeople** role.

	![Picture 5709](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image28.png)

	*This configuration results in using the **Salespeople** role and impersonating the user with your Michael Blythe’s name.*

14. Click **OK**.

	![Picture 5710](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image29.png)

15. Notice the yellow banner above the report page, describing the test security context.

	![Picture 13](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image30.png)

16. In the table visual, notice that only the salesperson **Michael Blythe** is listed.

	![Picture 5713](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image31.png)

17. To stop testing, at the right side of the yellow banner, click **Stop Viewing**.

	![Picture 5712](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image32.png)

	*When the Power BI Desktop file is published to the Power BI service, you’ll need to complete a post-publication task to map security principals to the **Salespeople** role. You won’t do that in this lab.*

18. To delete the role, on the **Modeling** ribbon tab, from inside the **Security** group, click **Manage Roles**.

	![Picture 16](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image33.png)

19. In the **Manage Roles** window, click **Delete**.

	![Picture 17](Linked_image_Files/lab10-image34.png)

20. When prompted to confirm the deletion, click **Yes, Delete**.

21. Click **Save**.
