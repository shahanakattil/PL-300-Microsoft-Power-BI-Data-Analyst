### **Task 3: Get started – Publish the report**

In this task you will setup the environment for the lab by creating a dataset.

*Important: If you have already published the report in the **Design a Report in Power BI Desktop, Part 2** lab, continue from the next task.*

1. In the Microsoft Edge browser window, in the Power BI service, navigate to My Workspace.
    
1. Select **Upload > Browse**.

4. In the **Open** window, navigate to the **C:\PL300\PL-300-Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst-prod\Allfiles\Labs\09-create-power-bi-dashboard\Starter** folder.

5. Select the **Sales Analysis.pbix** file, and then click **Open**.

6. If prompted to replace the dataset, click **Replace it**.

### **Task 4: Create a dashboard**

In this task you will create the **Sales Monitoring** dashboard. You will pin a visual from the report, and add a tile based on an image data URI, and use Q&A to create a tile.

1. In the Microsoft Edge browser window, in the Power BI service, open the **Sales Analysis** report.

2. In the **Overview** page, set the **Year** slicer to **FY2020**.

    ![Picture 4](Linked_image_Files/yearfy2020.png)

3. Set the **Region** slicer to **Select All**.

    *When pinning visuals to a dashboard, they will use the current filter context. Once pinned, the filter context cannot be changed. For time-based filters, it’s a better idea to use a relative date slicer (or, Q&A using a relative time-based question).*

4. To create a dashboard and pin a visual, hover the cursor over the S**ales and Profit Margin by Month** (column/line) visual, and select the **pushpin**.

    ![Picture 43](Linked_image_Files/module9image21.png)

6. In the **Pin to Dashboard** window, in the **Dashboard Name** box, enter **Sales Monitoring**.

    ![Picture 3](Linked_image_Files/module09dashboard.png)

7. Click **Pin**.

    ![Picture 1](Linked_image_Files/module09pin.png)

8. On the **Navigation** pane, select **My Workspace** and then open the **Sales Monitoring** dashboard.

    ![Picture 44](Linked_image_Files/upd-mod8.png)

9. Notice that the dashboard has a single tile.

    ![Picture 45](Linked_image_Files/module09askquery.png)

10. To add a tile based on a question, at the top-left of the dashboard, click **Ask a Question About Your Data**.

    ![Picture 7](Linked_image_Files/module-09query2.png)

    *You can use the Q&A feature to ask a question, and Power BI will respond will a visual.*

11. Click any one of the suggested questions beneath the Q&A box, in the boxes.

12. Review the response.

13. Remove all text from the Q&A box.

14. In the Q&A box, enter the following: **Sales YTD**

    ![Picture 11](Linked_image_Files/module-09-25.png)

15. Notice the response of **(Blank)**.

    ![Picture 14](Linked_image_Files/blank.png)

    *You may recall you added the **Sales YTD** measure in the **Create DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop, Part 2** lab. This measure is a Time Intelligence expression and it so requires a filter on the **Date** table to produce a result.*

16. Extend the question with: **in year FY2020**.

    ![Picture 12](Linked_image_Files/module09image-26.png)

17. Notice the response is now **$33M**.

     ![Picture 13](Linked_image_Files/33M.png)

     > **Note:** You might get the different value in response.

19. To pin the response to the dashboard, at the top-right corner, click **Pin Visual**.

    ![Picture 15](Linked_image_Files/module09pinvisual.png)

20. When prompted to pin the tile to the dashboard, click **Pin**.

    ![Picture 17](Linked_image_Files/module09pintodasboard.png)

21. To return to the dashboard, at the top-left corner, click **Exit Q&amp;A**.

    ![Picture 16](Linked_image_Files/module09exitQA.png)

22. To add the company logo, on the menu bar, click **Edit**, and then select **Add a Tile**.

    ![Picture 46](Linked_image_Files/module19image20.png)

    *Using this technique to add a dashboard tile lets you embellish your dashboard with media, including web content, images, richly-formatted text boxes, and video (using YouTube or Vimeo links).*

23. In the **Add a Tile** pane (located at the right), select the **Image** tile.

    ![Picture 47](Linked_image_Files/image.png)

24. Click **Next**.

    ![Picture 48](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image33.png)

25. In the **Add Image Tile** pane, in the **URL** box, enter the complete URL found in the **C:\PL300\PL-300-Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst-prod\Allfiles\Resources\AdventureWorksLogo_DataURL.txt** file.

    *You can embed an image by using its URL, or you can use a data URL, which embeds content inline.*

26. At the bottom of the pane, click **Apply**.

    ![Picture 49](Linked_image_Files/apply.png)

27. To resize the logo tile, drag the bottom-right corner, and resize the tile to become one unit wide, and two units high.

    *Tile sizes are constrained into a rectangular shape. It’s only possible to resize into multiples of the rectangular shape.*

28. Organize the tiles so that the logo appears at the top-left, with the **Sales YTD** tile beneath it, and the **Sales, Profit Margin** tile at the right.

    ![Picture 52](Linked_image_Files/module09-26.png)

    > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:

    - Navigate to the Lab Validation Page, from the upper right corner in the lab guide section.
    - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task. 
    - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.

3. Click **Apply**.

    ![Picture 20](Linked_image_Files/apply1.png)

4. Notice that the **Sales YTD** tile displays a subtitle.

    ![Picture 21](Linked_image_Files/33withy.png)

5. Edit the tile details for the **Sales, Profit Margin** tile.

6. In the **Tile Details** pane, in the **Functionality** section, check **Display Last Refresh Time**.

    ![Picture 22](Linked_image_Files/module09function.png)

7. Click **Apply**.

    ![Picture 23](Linked_image_Files/apply1.png)

8. Notice that the tile describes the last refresh time (which done when loading the data model in Power BI Desktop).


   > *You’ll refresh the dataset in the next exercise. Typically, this would be achieved by using scheduled refresh, in which case Power BI would use a gateway to connect to the SQL Server database. However, due to constraints in the classroom setup, there is no gateway. So, you’ll open Power BI Desktop, perform a manual data refresh, and then upload the file to your workspace.*

## **Exercise 2: Refresh the Dataset**

In this exercise you will first load sales order data for June 2020 into the **AdventureWorksDW2020** database. You will then open your Power BI Desktop file, perform a data refresh, and then upload the file to your workspace.

### **Task 1: Update the lab database**

In this task you will run a PowerShell script to update data in the **AdventureWorksDW2020** database.

1. In File Explorer, inside the **C:\PL300\PL-300-Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst-prod\Allfiles\Setup** folder, right-click the **UpdateDatabase-2-AddSales.ps1** file, and then select **Run with PowerShell**.

    ![Picture 28](Linked_image_Files/09-create-power-bi-dashboard_image46.png)

2. If prompted to change the execution policy, press **A**.

3. When prompted to press any key to close, press **Enter** again.

    *The **AdventureWorksDW2020** database now includes sales orders made in June 2020.*

### **Task 2: Refresh the Power BI Desktop file**

In this task you will open the **Sales Analysis** Power BI Desktop file, perform a data refresh, and then upload the file to your **Sales Analysis** workspace.

1. In Power BI Desktop file, in the **Fields** pane, right-click the **Sales** table, and then select **Refresh Data**.

    ![Picture 55](Linked_image_Files/module09refresh.png)

2. When the refresh completes, save the Power BI Desktop file.

3. To publish the file to your workspace, on the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Share** group, click **Publish** and then click **Select** to publish.

    ![Picture 59](Linked_image_Files/module09publish.png)

4. When prompted to replace the dataset, click **Replace**.

    ![Picture 31](Linked_image_Files/module09.29.png)

    *The dataset in the Power BI service now has June 2020 sales data.*

5. Close Power BI Desktop.

## **Exercise 3: Review the Dashboard**

In this exercise you will review the dashboard to notice updated sales.

### **Task 1: Review the dashboard**

In this task you will review the dashboard to notice updated sales.

1. In the Microsoft Edge browser window, in the Power BI service, review the **Sales Monitoring** dashboard.

2. In the **Sales, Profit Margin** tile, in the subtitle, notice that the data was **REFRESHED:NOW**.

3. Notice also that there is now a column for **2020 Jun**.

    *If you don’t see the June 2020 data, you might need to press **F5** to reload the web browser.*
